# Climbing English

This project was idealized by Wilsley Germano and Gabriel Jungles, as part of a series of projects conceived for Snow Academy.

Climbing English is a english dictionary, where the user can search for a english word and gets a definition.

The words definitions are provided by [Free Dictionary API](https://dictionaryapi.dev/).

Authentication and storage are provided by Google's Firebase.

Finally, state management by [Mobx](https://pub.dev/packages/mobx).

To run this project, you're going to need to clone this repo, flutter and dart installed, an IDE of your choice and do not forget to run "flutter pub get" the first time you run it.
